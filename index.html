           <h1>Welcome to Alba's playground</h1>
               <p>Alba, actually called <em>Motacilla alba</em> and <em> الذعرة</em> in Arabic are my new favourite bird. A family of Albas has been recently visiting us often, so I decided to learn evrything about them! Jump in, if you're interested as well! </p>

                    <p>The White Wagtail is a ubiquitous species that occupies a wide variety of open (non-forested) habitats across Eurasia. The species is represented by a complex of nine subspecies that exhibit marked variation in plumage pattern and coloration (gray vs. black) across its immense breeding range.</p>

                                    <p>is one of the more easily recognisable summer visitors to the UK, with its unmistakable bright yellow and green livery. However, a quick glance at the Yellow Wagtail page in the Collins Bird Guide, and the bewildering array of heads portrayed is more than enough to disprove this assumption, with races aplenty waiting to baffle and confuse.</p>
    
                                <ul><li><h3>Grey Wagtail</h3></li></ul>
                
                                    <p>The grey wagtail is more colourful than its name suggests with slate grey upper parts and distinctive lemon yellow under-tail. Its tail is noticeably longer than those of pied and yellow wagtails. They have gradually increased their range in the past 150 years and in the UK have expanded into the English lowlands from the northern and western uplands.</p>
