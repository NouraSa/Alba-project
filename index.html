                Alba, who ornithologists call Motacilla alba, and whose name in Arabic is الذعرة  is one of my new favourite birds. A family of Albas has been recently visiting us often, and I have since fallen in love with these cute birds. So I decided to learn more about them.  
                <br>The White Wagtail is a ubiquitous species that occupies a wide variety of open (non-forested) habitats across Eurasia. The species is represented by a complex of nine subspecies that exhibit marked variation in plumage pattern and coloration (gray vs. black) across its immense breeding range.

            The European robin (Erithacus rubecula), known simply as the robin, is a small insectivorous passerine bird that belongs to the chat subfamily of the Old World flycatcher family. The male and female are similar in colouration. It is found across Europe, east to Western Siberia and south to North Africa; it is sedentary in most of its range except the far north.

            It is one of several birds in the crow family designated magpies, and belongs to the Holarctic radiation of "monochrome" magpies. In Europe, "magpie" is used by English speakers as a synonym for the European magpie: the only other magpie in Europe is the Iberian magpie (Cyanopica cooki), which is limited to the Iberian Peninsula.

            Hoopoes (/ˈhuːpuː/) are colourful birds found across Africa, Asia, and Europe, notable for their distinctive "crown" of feathers. Three living and one extinct species are recognised, though for many years all of the extant species were lumped as a single species—Upupa epops.
